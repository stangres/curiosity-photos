          With its rover named Curiosity, Mars Science Laboratory mission is
          part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, a long-term effort of robotic
          exploration of the red planet. Curiosity was designed to assess
          whether Mars ever had an environment able to support small life forms
          called microbes. In other words, its mission is to determine the
          planet's "habitability."
